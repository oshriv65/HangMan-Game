## General info
- The game is simple, you need to guess the word, letter by letter until you get the full word.
- You have 7 tries but you can change the number of tries in the code, that's up to you.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* python version: 3.9 .
* visual studio code.
* os - Library used to create a shortcut to the path of the file "word" , where all the words to guess are.
* time - Library used to create delay between renders so the user could manage to see the results.

## Features
- You can add more words to guess, by adding them to "word.text" file!
- The number of guesses are changeable by change the number in "MAX_TRIES" variable

## Screenshots

- The number at bottom left is the number of tries you have.

## Setup
1. To run this project, you need just to install python
2. Make sure to get the correct path to the word.text! (The structure goes like this: ~/"the folder you put the file"/words.txt).
3. Run the script through the cmd/terminal, because the game is displayed in console promotion.

Example of the script run:
```
$ cd ../<The folder where the HangManGame file is located>
$ python HangManGame.py
$ Enter the destination to check: ~/Documents/words.txt
$ Please enter an index: 5
$ Let's Start!
  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ 

 Enter the guessed letter: 
```


## Project Status
The project is completed but no longer gets updated, because it was part of a course I took, and I moved on to other courses to expand my knowledge âš¡
